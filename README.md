Hospital Management System Database

Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a Hospital Management System Database using PostgreSQL. The system manages various hospital-related data such as hospitals, patients, employees, rooms, prescriptions, and more, with well-defined relationships.

Steps Involved

Schema Design:
Developed a comprehensive schema to outline the structure and define relationships between tables (hospitals, patients, employees, etc.). This was critical for ensuring proper data flow.

Table Creation:
Wrote SQL scripts to create the database tables with primary and foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity and maintain relationships between data.

Sample Data Insertion:
Inserted sample data across all tables (10 rows per table, except for hospitals with 1-3 rows) to simulate realistic hospital scenarios and to test the database.

Query Execution:
Ran 10 SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate the data, validating the correct behavior of the database and relationships.

How to Use
Clone the repository.
Set up a PostgreSQL database.
Run the provided SQL scripts to create the tables and insert the sample data.
Execute your own queries to test the functionality or use the provided queries.

Feel free to explore the system and modify it to suit your needs!
